# CropCare AI-Powered Crop Disease Monitoring 

This project will develop an innovative, user-friendly mobile phone application for early detection of potato diseases, a major concern for Finnish potato farmers that could be exacerbated by climate change.

The project will leverage the [National Plant Phenotyping Infrastructure (NaPPI)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/infrastructures/national-plant-phenotyping)
imaging facilities within the [University of Helsinki (UH)](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/), the advanced machine learning capabilities from the [University of Oulu (UO](https://www.oulu.fi/en)), and the experience of Pyhäjärvi-Institute as an advisory partner.
